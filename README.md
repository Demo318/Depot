# The Depot App

A follow-along project from [*Agile Web Development with Rails 7*](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/) by [Sam Ruby](https://intertwingly.net/blog/).

As each chapter corrects my bad habits, this repository serves as a reference library for how a Ruby on Rails applications *should* be written.

## Start-Up Procedure

1. Install (or enable, if you're using a version manager) [Ruby 3.3.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

2. Install the [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) gem (if you haven't already) with `$ gem install bundler`.

3. Clone this repo, and navigate to the directory where `Gemfile` is located.

4. Run `$ bundle install` to install dependencies.

5. Run `$ rails server` to start development server, which by default will go live at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Rails Reference

Below are a collection of notes I've gleaned from the book along the way.
